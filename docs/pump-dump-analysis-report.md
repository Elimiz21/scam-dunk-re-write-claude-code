## Executive Summary

|--------|-------|
| **Average Days to Peak** | 8.6 trading days |

**Bottom Line:** Investors who bought at promoted peak prices lost an average of **63.9%** of their investment.

## Methodology

For each stock, the analysis tracked:

1. **Promotion Start** - Date when coordinated promotional activity began
2. **Promotion Price** - Stock price at start of promotional campaign
3. **Peak Price** - Highest price reached during pump phase
4. **Days to Peak** - Trading days from promotion start to price peak
5. **Trough Price** - Lowest price after the collapse

5. Promotion stops, price collapses

```
Day 0-3:    Promotional content published across channels
Day 3-6:    Retail buying accelerates, volume spikes

3. **Unrealistic Claims** - "Next Tesla" or "1000% potential" language
4. **Urgency Language** - "Buy before it's too late" messaging
5. **Anonymous Sources** - Promotion from unverifiable "analysts"

## Investor Impact Analysis

### Hypothetical Loss Scenarios

| Investment Amount | At Peak | At Trough (Avg -63.9%) |
|------------------|---------|------------------------|
| $1,000 | $1,000 | $361 |
| $5,000 | $5,000 | $1,805 |
| $10,000 | $10,000 | $3,610 |
| $50,000 | $50,000 | $18,050 |
| $100,000 | $100,000 | $36,100 |

**An investor who put $100,000 into these stocks at peak prices would have lost approximately $63,900 on average.**

---

## Conclusion

The "Grandmaster-Obi" pump-and-dump scheme demonstrates classic securities manipulation patterns:

1. **Artificial Price Inflation:** Stocks showed an average gain of **+322.7%** during the promotional period through coordinated buying and promotional campaigns

2. **Rapid Collapse:** After reaching peak prices, all 10 stocks declined an average of **-63.9%**, with the worst performer (ANPA) losing **77.3%**

3. **Sustained Damage:** Current prices remain an average of **52.1%** below peak levels, suggesting no recovery

4. **Speed of Scheme:** The average pump cycle lasted only **8.6 trading days** from promotion to peak, making it difficult for regulators to intervene before damage was done

### Key Takeaways

- **Warning Signs Were Present:** Unusual volume, coordinated social media activity, and unrealistic promotional claims preceded every collapse
- **Small-Cap Biotech Focus:** 7 of 10 stocks were small-cap biotech/healthcare companies with complex products retail investors couldn't easily evaluate
- **Social Media Amplification:** YouTube, Twitter, and StockTwits were primary vectors for promotional content

---

## Recommendations for Investors

1. **Be skeptical of unsolicited stock tips**, especially from social media
2. **Research promotional claims** through SEC filings, not promotional videos
3. **Watch for volume spikes** without corresponding news
4. **Avoid stocks promoted with urgency language**
5. **Check who benefits** from promotional content
