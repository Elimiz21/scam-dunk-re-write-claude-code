## "Grandmaster-Obi" Operation

**Report Date:** February 5, 2026
**Analysis Period:** June 2024 - Present
**Data Source:** Financial Modeling Prep API, SEC Filings

---

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes 10 stocks promoted by the "Grandmaster-Obi" pump-and-dump operation, as detailed in the SEC enforcement action (SEC v. Obioha et al.) and DOJ criminal complaint. The scheme used coordinated social media promotion, fake YouTube videos, and misleading newsletters to artificially inflate stock prices before insiders sold their positions.

### Key Findings

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Average Days to Peak** | 8.6 trading days |
| **Average Days from Peak to Trough** | 18.4 trading days |
| **Average Gain During Pump Phase** | +322.7% |
| **Average Peak-to-Trough Decline** | -63.9% |
| **Average Trough vs Pre-Promotion Price** | +45.6% |
| **Average Current vs Pre-Promotion Price** | +48.8% |
| **Average Current Price vs Peak** | -52.1% |

### Key Insight

While stocks collapsed an average of **63.9%** from peak to trough, they ended up **45.6% above** pre-promotion prices at their lowest point. This indicates that:

1. **Insiders profited massively** - they bought at pre-promotion prices and sold near peaks (+322.7% gain)
2. **Late retail investors lost heavily** - those who bought during promotion lost 60%+ of their investment
3. **Early retail investors actually gained** - those who bought pre-promotion and held through the collapse still ended up +45.6% at trough

**Bottom Line:** The scheme transferred wealth from late-arriving retail investors to scheme insiders.

---

## Methodology

For each stock, the analysis tracked:

1. **Pre-Promotion Price** - Stock price before promotional activity began
2. **Promotion Start** - Date when coordinated promotional activity began
3. **Peak Price** - Highest price reached during pump phase
4. **Days to Peak** - Trading days from promotion start to price peak
5. **Trough Price** - Lowest price after the collapse
6. **Days to Trough** - Trading days from peak to trough
7. **Current Price** - Most recent trading price

### Calculations

- **Gain to Peak** = (Peak - Pre-Promotion) / Pre-Promotion × 100
- **Peak-to-Trough Decline** = (Trough - Peak) / Peak × 100
- **Trough vs Pre-Promotion** = (Trough - Pre-Promotion) / Pre-Promotion × 100
- **Current vs Pre-Promotion** = (Current - Pre-Promotion) / Pre-Promotion × 100

---

## Scheme Overview

The "Grandmaster-Obi" operation employed a multi-channel promotional strategy:

- **YouTube Videos** - Fake analyst videos with AI-generated content promoting target stocks
- **Social Media** - Coordinated Twitter/X, Reddit, and StockTwits campaigns
- **Newsletters** - Paid promotional emails disguised as investment research
- **Discord/Telegram** - Private groups for coordinated buying

The typical pattern:
1. Insiders accumulate shares at low prices
2. Promotional campaign launches across multiple channels
3. Retail investors buy, driving price up rapidly
4. Insiders sell at peak prices
5. Promotion stops, price collapses
6. Retail investors left with massive losses

├── Day 9-14:   Insiders sell, price begins decline
├── Day 14-20:  Collapse accelerates as promotion stops
└── Day 20-27:  Trough reached (average: 18.4 days after peak)

```

### Key Timing Insights

| Phase | Duration | Price Movement |

| Pump Phase | ~9 days | +322.7% |
| Dump Phase | ~18 days | -63.9% |
| Total Cycle | ~27 days | +45.6% vs pre-promo |

**The dump takes twice as long as the pump** - prices rise quickly on coordinated buying but fall more gradually as selling is distributed.

|-----------|---------|------|

|-----------|-----------------|------|
| Peak price | 36.1% of investment | **-63.9%** average |

|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| Pre-promotion price | 145.6% of investment | **+45.6%** average |

## Conclusion

The "Grandmaster-Obi" pump-and-dump scheme demonstrates classic securities manipulation patterns:

### 1. Artificial Price Inflation
Stocks showed an average gain of **+322.7%** during the promotional period through coordinated buying and promotional campaigns.

### 2. Rapid Collapse
After reaching peak prices, all 10 stocks declined an average of **-63.9%** over approximately **18.4 trading days**, with the worst performer (ANPA) losing **77.3%**.

### 3. Prices Stabilized Above Pre-Promotion Levels
At trough, stocks remained an average of **+45.6%** above pre-promotion prices. Current prices average **+48.8%** above pre-promotion levels.

### 4. Speed of Scheme
The average pump cycle lasted only **8.6 trading days** from promotion to peak, making it difficult for regulators to intervene before damage was done.

### 5. Wealth Transfer
The scheme effectively transferred wealth from late-arriving retail investors (who bought near peaks) to insiders (who accumulated at pre-promotion prices and sold near peaks).

## Key Takeaways

- **Warning Signs Were Present:** Unusual volume, coordinated social media activity, and unrealistic promotional claims preceded every collapse
- **Small-Cap Biotech Focus:** 7 of 10 stocks were small-cap biotech/healthcare companies with complex products retail investors couldn't easily evaluate
- **Social Media Amplification:** YouTube, Twitter, and StockTwits were primary vectors for promotional content
- **Timing is Everything:** Insiders made +322.7%, late retail investors lost -63.9%

---

## Recommendations for Investors

1. **Be skeptical of unsolicited stock tips**, especially from social media
2. **Research promotional claims** through SEC filings, not promotional videos
3. **Watch for volume spikes** without corresponding news
4. **Avoid stocks promoted with urgency language**
5. **Check who benefits** from promotional content
6. **Recognize the pattern:** Rapid gains over 8-9 days followed by collapse is a red flag
