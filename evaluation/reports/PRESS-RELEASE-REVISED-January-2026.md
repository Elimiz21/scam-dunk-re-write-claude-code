# ScamDunk AI Analysis: 110+ Micro-Cap Stocks Show Signs of Market Manipulation

**PRESS RELEASE — FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**January 2026**

---

## Executive Summary

An independent analysis of 6,290 US-listed stocks using ScamDunk's AI-powered risk detection system has identified **over 110 micro-cap stocks** exhibiting high-confidence patterns consistent with market manipulation, including classic "pump-and-dump" schemes.

**Key Finding:** 24 stocks show the most alarming combination — **BOTH** a pump-and-dump price pattern AND unusual volume explosions — concentrated among penny stocks with market caps under $15 million.

An additional **66 stocks** are on a watch list showing volume explosions that may indicate pump schemes in early stages, before the "dump" phase occurs.

## The Numbers

| Finding | Count | Confidence |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Stocks with pump-and-dump pattern | 183 | Detected by AI |
| **After removing large-cap false positives** | — | — |
| High-confidence manipulation candidates | **110** | Micro-cap (<$50M) |
| Very high confidence (multiple signals) | **30** | Score 11+ |
| Stocks with BOTH pattern types | **24** | Strongest evidence |
| Early-stage watch list | **66** | Volume explosion only |

---

## What We Found

### Pattern 1: Classic Pump-and-Dump

Our AI detected 183 stocks where prices spiked at least 25% before dropping 20% or more within a 15-day window. After excluding 8 large-cap stocks with legitimate reasons for volatility (earnings, sector movements, news), **110 micro-cap stocks remain as high-confidence manipulation candidates**.

### Pattern 2: Volume Explosions

90 stocks showed trading volume 3-5x their 30-day average — a classic sign of coordinated buying. When combined with price patterns:
- **24 stocks** show BOTH volume explosion AND price collapse (strongest evidence)
- **66 stocks** show volume explosion but NO price drop yet (potential early-stage schemes)

## Where the Manipulation Is Concentrated

### By Exchange

| Exchange | HIGH Risk Stocks | % of Exchange |
|----------|------------------|---------------|
| **AMEX** | 103 | 37.9% |
| **NASDAQ** | 953 | 25.9% |
| NYSE | 40 | 1.7% |

AMEX and NASDAQ small-cap listings show significantly higher manipulation risk.

### By Market Cap

| Market Cap | Pump-and-Dump Stocks | Assessment |
|------------|---------------------|------------|
| Large Cap (>$1B) | 8 | Likely legitimate volatility |
| Mid Cap ($300M-$1B) | 17 | Requires individual investigation |
| Small Cap ($50M-$300M) | 48 | Elevated concern |
| **Micro Cap (<$50M)** | **110** | **Highest manipulation risk** |

---

## Notable Exclusions

Our analysis detected pump-and-dump patterns in several well-known stocks that we assessed as **legitimate volatility**, not manipulation:

- **DJT (Trump Media)** — Political/news-driven volatility, high retail interest
- **TLRY (Tilray)** — Cannabis sector known for volatility
- **INFY (Infosys)** — $74B company, earnings-driven movements
- **FLY (Firefly Aerospace)** — Space sector speculation

These stocks were excluded from our manipulation count to ensure conservative, defensible statistics.
