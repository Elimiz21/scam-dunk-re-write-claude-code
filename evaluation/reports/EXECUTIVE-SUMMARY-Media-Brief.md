## The Story

An AI-powered analysis of nearly every tradeable US stock has identified over 1,000 securities exhibiting warning signs consistent with market manipulation schemes.

The most alarming finding: **183 stocks are currently displaying classic "pump-and-dump" signatures** — a pattern where prices spike dramatically before crashing, leaving late-arriving retail investors with significant losses.

**Where the risk is concentrated:**
- **AMEX:** 37.9% of listings flagged as HIGH risk
- **NASDAQ small-caps:** 25.9% flagged as HIGH risk
- **NYSE:** Only 1.7% flagged (primarily large, liquid stocks)

## What ScamDunk Detects

The system looks for two types of warning signs:

### 1. Structural Red Flags
- Penny stocks (under $5)
- Small market caps (under $300M)
- Low trading volume (easy to manipulate)

### 2. Active Manipulation Patterns
- **Pump-and-Dump:** Price spikes 25%+ then drops 20%+ within 15 days
- **Volume Explosions:** Trading 3-5x above normal with no news
- **Coordinated Price Moves:** Abnormal 7-day movements

## Why This Matters Now

1. **Retail investor surge:** More individual investors in markets than ever
2. **Social media coordination:** Discord, Reddit, Telegram enable pump schemes
3. **Regulatory lag:** SEC enforcement often comes after damage is done
4. **Information asymmetry:** Professional traders spot patterns; retail investors don't
