- However, these are "high-beta, high-volatility plays that often involve chasing momentum"
- Reddit's market influence makes it difficult to distinguish legitimate commentary from manipulation

- Platform is prone to botting, pump-and-dump schemes, and repetitive posting

4. **Obscure companies** with limited public information
5. **Promoters not disclosing** they were paid to promote

### From Timothy Sykes:

- "If someone is funding advertising of a stock instead of funding the company - that's a blatant pump"
- Stock pumps often done to enable financing at inflated prices
- "Never believe the hype, do your due diligence before trading any penny stock"
- Low volume "free penny stock alerts" are often pump-and-dump setups
