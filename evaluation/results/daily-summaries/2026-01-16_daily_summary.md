| Symbol | Catalyst | Suspicious Elements |
|--------|----------|---------------------|
| VERO | 91% stake + delisting | Extreme volatility |

## Cross-Reference Analysis

### Social Media Stocks vs FMP Universe

Many social media promoted stocks are NOT in the FMP universe (likely OTC/micro-cap):

| Status | Stocks |
|--------|--------|
| **In FMP HIGH Risk** | EVTV |
| **Not in FMP Universe** | SPHL, VERO, JFBR, ANPA, MRNO, MLGO, JTAI, SMX, SIDU, SXTC, VLN |

**Implication**: Pump schemes deliberately target stocks outside standard market data coverage for detection avoidance.
