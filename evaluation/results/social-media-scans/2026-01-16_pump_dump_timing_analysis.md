### 2. Non-Discord Pumps Are Faster and More Dangerous

| Pattern | Pump Duration | Dump Duration | Predictability |
|---------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| SCHEME-001 | 2-3 days | 2-5 days | HIGH (alert visible) |
| Social Media | 1 day | 1-2 days | MEDIUM |
| Intraday P&D | Hours | Hours | LOW (too fast) |

### 3. Warning Signs Timeline

| Days Before Peak | Signal |
|------------------|--------|
| 0-1 days | SPIKE_7D appears |
| 0-1 days | VOLUME_EXPLOSION appears |
| 0-2 days | OVERBOUGHT_RSI appears |
| 1-3 days after peak | SPIKE_THEN_DROP appears |

---

## Detection Window Analysis

### How Early Can We Detect?

| Stock | First HIGH Rating | Peak Date | Warning Days |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|--------------|
| MTEN | Jan 11 | Jan 9 | **AFTER** (too late) |
| SXTC | Jan 11 | Jan 8 | **AFTER** (too late) |
| THH | Jan 11 | Jan 13 | 2 days before |
| SPHL | - | Jan 15 | - |
| EVTV | Jan 11 | Jan 12-13 | 1-2 days before |

### Improvement Needed

```
CURRENT DETECTION:
├── Daily scans catch stocks AFTER major movement
├── SPIKE_7D requires 7-day lookback
├── SPIKE_THEN_DROP detected AFTER dump begins

IDEAL DETECTION:
├── Intraday monitoring for volume spikes
├── Discord/Stocktwits alert monitoring
├── Real-time unusual activity alerts
├── 1-day lookback for rapid movers
```

## Summary Statistics

### SCHEME-001 (Grandmaster-Obi Discord)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Stocks Confirmed | 13+ |
| Average Pump Duration | 2-3 days |
| Average Peak Gain | +465% |
| Average Drop from Peak | -35% |
| Worst Drop | -70% (SPHL) |
| Dump Duration | 2-5 days |
| Detection Rate | 100% (all flagged HIGH) |
| Early Detection | ~50% (flagged before peak) |

### All Other Pumps

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Stocks Identified | 5 |
| Average Pump Duration | <1 day |
| Average Peak Gain | +85% |
| Average Drop | -40% to -97% |
| Dump Duration | Same day to 3 days |
| Detection Rate | 100% (all flagged HIGH) |
| Early Detection | ~20% (too fast) |

## Recommendations

### For Detection

1. **Add intraday monitoring** for stocks showing >50% moves
2. **Monitor Discord/Stocktwits** message volume in real-time
3. **Shorter lookback windows** (1-3 days) for SPIKE detection
4. **Alert on VOLUME_EXPLOSION** before price moves complete

### For Investors

1. **SCHEME-001 stocks**: Expect dump within 3-5 days of peak
2. **Intraday pumps (MTEN/SXTC)**: Avoid entirely - too fast
3. **News-driven spikes**: Often dump within 24-48 hours
4. **Any stock up >100% in a week**: HIGH probability of dump
