## Detection Validation

### System Performance
| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| SCHEME-001 stocks detected | 2/2 (100%) |
| Legitimate catalysts identified | 19/30 scanned (63%) |
| Corporate distress identified | 4/30 (13%) |
| False positive rate | ~17% (5 uncertain) |

### Key Insight
Most HIGH risk signals during Jan 15-16 were driven by:
1. **Tech/AI news** (ASTS, RIOT, IREN - legitimate)
2. **Biotech catalysts** (ANVS, CATX, HYPR - legitimate)
3. **Financial policy** (UWMC - Trump MBS order)
4. **SCHEME-001 activity** (VERO, SPHL - confirmed pumps)

---

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Action
1. **VERO** - Active SCHEME-001 stock, expect dump within 3-5 days
2. **CHEV** - Needs deeper investigation (extreme gains, tiny company)

### For Monitoring
1. **MVST** - Popular Reddit stock, watch for coordinated activity
2. **TC** - AI/crypto pivot could attract pump schemes
3. **LHAI** - Post-crash, may see secondary pump attempt

### System Improvements
1. Add intraday monitoring for >50% moves
2. Cross-reference with Discord alert channels in real-time
3. Flag stocks with extreme gains (>500% yearly) + tiny employee counts
