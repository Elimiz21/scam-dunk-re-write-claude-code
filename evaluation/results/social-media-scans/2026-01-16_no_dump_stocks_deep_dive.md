## Key Insights

### Why These 15 Didn't "Dump"

1. **6 had legitimate catalysts** (clinical trials, M&A, defense contracts) that justified price increases

2. **5 crashed from BAD news** (FDA rejections, drug discontinuation, delisting notices) - not pump-and-dumps, but distressed companies

3. **3 are uncertain** - may have had brief speculative pumps but lack evidence of coordination

4. **Only 1 (MYPSW)** appears to be pure speculation with no catalyst

### Detection Improvement Recommendations

1. **Cross-reference with news feeds** - Many "pump" signals were actually legitimate catalysts
2. **Flag FDA/clinical trial dates** - Biotech spikes often tied to data readouts
3. **Track M&A rumors** - Acquisition targets show similar patterns to pumps
4. **Differentiate warrant speculation** - Near-expiry warrants behave differently
